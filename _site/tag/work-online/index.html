			<h2> WCW: Taylor, Founder of Remote Like Me</h2>
			<div class="background-image" style="background-image:url('')">

			</div>
			<p>
				 <p>I am starting a new feature on my blog called Women Crush Wednesday where once a month I am going to feature boss babes that are killing the online world. I want to feature entrepreneurs that are kicking ass out there in the world. This week I am featuring Taylor Lane, Founder of Remote Like Me. </p>

<p>Taylor is the ultimate boss babe! She has been running Remote Like Me for over a year now. It’s a company that helps woman of all careers go remote. She does one on one coaching for women but she also has a series of memberships that you can join where she will help you on different levels for people with different needs. </p>

<p>She has a 3 month road map for success. This means that in just 3 months she will take you from 0 to remote working hero in just 3 months. Taylor’s goal is to help as many women go remote as possible. She’s a remote queen! </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/14680535-1294069683950145-8224432922045626532-n-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more or joining one of Tay’s memberships, head <a href="http://remotelikeme.com/join">here!</a></p>

<p>So what’s Taylor’s story:</p>

<p>“My mind used to be made up too. I will dread going to work every day for the rest of my life.<br />Let’s face it, that’s just normal… SMACK!<br />I can’t believe I ever thought about life that way. Here’s the story of how it all changed.</p>

<p>In 2014 I had the opportunity to travel to Guatemala and volunteer with people with special needs. As soon as I saw the world through eyes other than my own, a light switched on inside of me. From that moment on, teaching within the same four walls every day did not bring me joy. After returning to Guatemala many times, I knew I needed to find a way to fund a lifestyle centered around travel. There was one small problem. I had no idea where to start.</p>

<p>So I did what any bright, blonde, 22 year old girl would do. In 2015, I moved to Central America to figure it out. I spent my days exploring, my nights bartending, and any waking moment I had left on researching the remote lifestyle. I applied to a handful of remote jobs and luckily landed one with an email marketing company. I had set myself free! I spent the next year of my life working from my laptop and traveling the world. Mexico, Lithuania, Colombia, Morocco, Spain, the list goes on. Friends, family, and straight up strangers wanted to know how it’s done. I saw so many deserving people with a strong desire to work remotely with no idea where to start out. I had to do something…</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/28378671-1851055961584845-8694184414926166841-n-2.png" alt="" srcset="/uploads/28378671-1851055961584845-8694184414926166841-n-2.png 480w, /uploads/28378671-1851055961584845-8694184414926166841-n-2@2x.png 960w" /></p>

<p>I experimented by sending a few newsletters, listing remote job opportunities in various industries and the results were insane! People started applying and landing jobs right away. I was screaming with joy (literally) and knew I could continue to help people all over the world. Now I run memberships, create courses, and write guides on how to find remote jobs.</p>

<p>I’ve been helping girls like you go remote like me since January, 2017.”</p>

<p>Now Tay is going to keep changing lives and helping girls making their dreams a reality hopefully forever! If you are interested in working with Taylor,<a href="http://remotelikeme.com">check out her site</a>. Her membership is only open for a limited time, so get in while you can.</p>

<p>Taylor runs 3 memberships, each for people at a different level of their remote job search! She has a <a href="http://remotelikeme.com/join">monthly weekly roundup</a> where she sends you weekly jobs that she hand picks for members. She has the <a href="http://remotelikeme.com/join">Remote Like Us membership</a> where she has video trainings, pdfs and you still get those weekly emails. Lastly, she has the <a href="http://remotelikeme.com/join">VIP membership</a> where you get everything I’ve already listed plus resume checks, interview help and group coaching! This is the ultimate resource for getting a remote career.</p>

			<h2> 15 Tools That Every Digital Nomad Should Have</h2>
			<div class="background-image" style="background-image:url('')">
				<!-- this is a background image -->
			</div>
			<p>
				 <p>Being a digital nomad requires that you have a few essential things with you all the time. I easily manage travel full time but I wouldn’t be able to do it without all of these things in my back pack!</p>

<h4 id="hp-spectre-laptop">HP Spectre Laptop.</h4>

<p>This Laptop is amazing. I cannot speak highly of it. It’s light weight and extremely powerful. It has an incredible 4k touch screen that I use for Digital Illustration. The screen has 4k resolution and this computer is a winner when it comes to multitasking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076QQRWZF/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B076QQRWZF&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=5e37456efd9b9e13bb01c8f73e81d2d8"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B076QQRWZF&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;tag=justynjen07-20" alt="" /></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B076QQRWZF" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="the-surface-arc-mouse">The Surface Arc Mouse.</h4>

<p>This mouse folds up to be basically flat. I love it. The battery life lasts forever and it folds right down to fit into my computer bag. I love having a mouse on hand.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FG7MZP0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FG7MZP0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=4328e332ee86100cd780d166ba3c0085"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B00FG7MZP0&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;tag=justynjen07-20" alt="" /></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00FG7MZP0" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="the-surface-pro-pen">The Surface Pro Pen.</h4>

<p>I promise I don’t even have a surface, I just LOVE their products for touch screen computers and travel. This pen is amazing. It takes my design work to the next levels, and allows me to make personal notes of my portfolio to point out to people exactly what I want them to see. (Certain computers do come with their own pen, but it your doesn’t, check this out!) Another GREAT option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076VQB8DQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B076VQB8DQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=d6ac9b298f38926af03de3c1acbb7af3">Wacom Bamboo Ink Smart Stylus Black Active Touch Pen Stylus for Windows 10 Touchscreen Input Devices Surface Pro - CS321AK</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B076VQB8DQ" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="battery-pack">Battery pack.</h4>

<p>Having a really good battery pack can really change things for you. Being able to charge your phone on the go is amazing. This way you can always be available to check the map, answer an email, call someone, or do anything else while out and about. Just throw the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X5RV14Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00X5RV14Y&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=fbe67f8801a333f5ec3f791e343f36a9">Anker PowerCore External Battery Pack</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00X5RV14Y" alt="" /> into your bag and you are ready to go all day, and all night.</p>

<h4 id="bagsmart-travel-universal-cable-organizer-electronics-accessories-case"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B017SKRWL4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B017SKRWL4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=f4ba58a30a67154500fe3fc6e466bde5">BAGSMART Travel Universal Cable Organizer Electronics Accessories Case</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B017SKRWL4" alt="" />.</h4>

<p>What better way to stay organized then with a power cord organizer?! This way you can always find what you are looking for. No more lost cords, anywhere! I love it. I swear I have always been that person that loses all their cords and then finds them all tangled into one jumbled mess! But no more! Now I can always find everything and it’s amazing. You have to get one of these. Just throw it into your bag and you will always have everything you need.</p>

<h4 id="power-converter">Power converter.</h4>

<p>I really cannot recommend enough that you grab one of these before taking off on your next trip. Let me just tell you a quick horror story about foreign plugs and power. THEY ARENT GREAT. I spent about 7 months living in Bali and during that time I had two friends gopros break and my LAPTOP BROKE. The power in Bali blew my motherboard. That’s right. It fried my computer. And you know why? Because I used some cheapo plug that I bought for a dollar. And like I said, I had multiple friends blow their gopros and have them just stop charging. Not to mention phones blowing and more. The power in the country was wack and now I always travel with a high tech power converter to make sure that NEVER happens to me again. Check this one out, it does a great job and I always feel much safer using it. Don’t risk it guys! This is a lot cheaper than replacing all your nice electronics when they blow out.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E140XWA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01E140XWA&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=1a291f2776b3a38ad3181324416f7ed1"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B01E140XWA&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;tag=justynjen07-20" alt="" /></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B01E140XWA" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="roost-laptop-stand-"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C9KG8IG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01C9KG8IG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=cf2811f73502d76c252843e988fcb71a">Roost Laptop Stand </a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B01C9KG8IG" alt="" />.</h4>

<p>This is the best way to save your back when you are always working from your laptop. They always say that it’s best no to be looking down at your screen all day, and this guy folds right up to travel with you! You can easily throw it in your laptop bag and head out and about.</p>

<h4 id="travel-microphone">Travel Microphone.</h4>

<p>Now a travel microphone might not be for everyone, but I really think that it comes in handy more than people think it will. This little guy folds right up to fit basically anywhere. Pull him out to record podcasts, interviews, webinars, online classes and more. Never be hard to hear again! This will change everything for you. Plus I really think it just looks so cute.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FQE337M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00FQE337M&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=ee1f666af47df117aa56f85df16ac306"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=B00FQE337M&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL160_&amp;tag=justynjen07-20" alt="" /></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00FQE337M" alt="" /></p>

<p>Having a good pair of bluetooth headphones is the best. These little guys don’t even have cords that you have to deal with. You just throw them in your purse or backpack and then you always have them when you need them. Say goodbye to messy cords and always having to untangle your headphones. This will solve all those problems for you.</p>

<h4 id="universal-surge-protector--power-strip"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000784H4K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000784H4K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=b32f54eba7eb2fa8ffd34d9d51d2f1f8">Universal Surge Protector / Power Strip</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000784H4K" alt="" />.</h4>

<p>Yes I carry this bad boy around with me everywhere and guess what - it may look nerdy but it comes in SO HANDY. Never have to fight over plugs again! Only one plug in the cafe or hostel room? No worries! No plugs around at the airport? NO WORRIES! Plus it’s universal, so everyone from anywhere can plug in and use it as well. They are going to love you. Yes all my friends thought I was crazy at first, but now, they love that I pack this bad boy around. I totally recommend getting one.</p>

<h4 id="fjallraven-kanken-backpack"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AZ0ZR20/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01AZ0ZR20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=justynjen07-20&amp;linkId=7e5df2b28db81260ded7900cebb4cce1">Fjallraven Kanken Backpack</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B01AZ0ZR20" alt="" />.</h4>

<p>This backpack has changed the game for me. This bad boy holds EVERYTHING and opens up flat to easily find all your things. No more digging around in a dark backpack looking for things. You won’t need to do that ever again. The other thing that I love about this bag is that it has the back laptop compartment and then another pocket in the main section that I can put books and journals. This style has the padded arm pads and the big water bottle packet on the side. I can’t do anywhere without it. It holds all my gadgets and my camera easily. And they are well made and last forever!</p>

<p>This phone might not be your first choice when you think of your next upgrade, but let me let you know right now why you need this phone as a digital nomad. First thing, my whole life and business are in my google drive and this is the google phone. Meaning this phone connects directly to my business. It also has A TON of storage and an amazing camera. You can snap all the travel pics to make your friends and family jealous. Plus it still costs a lot less than the beloved iPhone.</p>

<p>I don’t go anywhere without my storage device. It is my life. Everything goes straight from my laptop to my google drive and my portable storage. I don’t leave anything up to chance, I back everything up. I love having my storage drive to store photos, websites and word documents and eBooks. I have this thing organized hardcore and if anything was my personal assistant, it would be this.</p>

<p>If you have this bad boy you don’t need much else. Never worry about Wi-Fi again because you finally have your own to carry around with you all the time. I wouldn’t be able to survive without the Skyroam. It’s a total game changer. Every digital nomad out there needs one of these now.</p>

			<h2> Pinterest For Business - How Pinterest Can Help You Grow</h2>

			</div>
			<p>
				 <p>Are you on Pinterest? Chances are, that answer is yes! However, are you using Pinterest to help you grow your business? That answer might be no…<br /><br />Your next question for me might be something like, “How can Pinterest help me grow my business? Pinterest is for cooking and weddings and wasting time.” You have never been more wrong.<br /><br />Pinterest is one of the most effective ways to send traffic to your website or blog and explode your business. It’s about time we take Pinterest out of the social media category and put it in the business tools category.<br /><br />Pinterest is the strongest tool to grow blog traffic for sure. Bloggers looking to up their traffic and make money through their affiliates, should be ALL over Pinterest. Another great way for bloggers to make money with Pinterest is to have their products on Pinterest for people to see and buy. I have found that worksheets, downloads and eBooks are great products to sell on Pinterest!<br /><br />Does your business have physical products? No worries! Things like home furnishings, scrapbook/journaling supplies, clothes, kitchen wares, art and photos also do well selling on Pinterest. It can actually help you sell everything. You see brands like Target and Nike advertising on Pinterest, so why would you ignore this platform for selling! I’ve been helping bloggers and small business owners grow their following and drive thousands of people to their websites every month! How am I doing that?</p>

<h4 id="steps-to-having-the-best-pinterest-for-your-business">Steps to having the BEST Pinterest for your business!</h4>

<p>First, go ahead and switch to a business account</p>

<p>Then you need to set up the right boards for your business</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/screenshot-38-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>After that you should sign up for <a href="https://www.tailwindapp.com/i/justynjen">Tailwindapp</a> and use it to your advantage! I usually am pinning at least 20-25 times a day!</p>

<p> </p>

<p><img src="/uploads/screenshot-40.png" alt="" srcset="/uploads/screenshot-40.png 504w, /uploads/screenshot-40@2x.png 1008w" /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The next thing to do is just be putting out new pins constantly. Like I said above, I usually put out 20 pins a day at least.</p>

<p>Another important thing to do is create multiple pins for every product and post that you have.</p>

<p>Lastly, make sure that you have analytics setup for your website so that you can track all of your growth. </p>

<p>With all of this, you should see a serious change in your business and Pinterest traffic in just a matter of weeks!</p>

<p>Does that sound a bit overwhelming or you just don’t know where to start? That makes sense. Resetting your current pinterest mindset and getting to the point where you are pinning right for you business can be difficult.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/screenshot-41.png" alt="" srcset="/uploads/screenshot-41.png 1009w, /uploads/screenshot-41@2x.png 2018w" /></p>

<p>I have worked out a strategy on how to target and direct that growth in the shortest amount of time. If you would like to learn more about it, you can book a <a href="https://calendly.com/justyngourdin/15-minute-consult">FREE 15 minute consultation</a> with me and I will take a look at your accounts and let you know how I can help you make magic for your business through Pinterest. </p>

			<h2> 15 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Boston, Massachusetts</h2>

				 <p>Boston is THE city to visit for all the food, baseball and history things you could hope for in America! I could have stayed forever. I walked all along the freedom trail, ate about 13 meals a day and wandered in and out of hundreds of unique little stores. All in all, Boston was a dream come true. I hope these photos inspire you to visit Boston right away!</p>

			<h2> How I Got Started As A Digital Nomad</h2>
			<div class="background-image" style="background-image:url('')">
				<!-- this is a background image -->
			</div>
			<p>
				 <p>Do you ever wonder how I travel to amazing places and make spectacular adventures without coming back to the states to work? That is the biggest question I get from almost everyone. They wonder what I do for money, how I do it and how I get to travel all the time while doing it. This post is meant to teach you all my secrets!<br /><br />First things first, I do not travel the world for free and I do not travel without working. Surprise! I work full time online while also traveling full time (which is a full-time job). So, you could say that I am a busy woman. But, I am living the life of my dreams! And you can too.<br /><br />I started working online less than a year ago. Before that I was just traveling full time and running out of money. You may have heard my story before of how I got started working but let me share it again.<br /><br />After 2 years of full time travel I ran out of money. I spent my last dollars on a blogging course in Bali with the Blonde Abroad and that was it. Unfortunately, shortly after the retreat began, I realized that I wasn’t going to start making money immediately on my blog just because I spent two weeks working with an awesome blogger.  Which then made me realize that my only options were to look for some kind of job abroad or fly home. Then I remembered I didn’t have any money to book a ticket home so, I was stranded in Bali with nowhere to live, no job and obviously, no money.<br /><br />That’s when things were truly bad, but also actually good. I was swimming at the pool with some friends when I confided in them that I had no money and nowhere to live. My new bestie Esther offered to let me live with her while she did a pet sitting gig in Denpasar.  This meant free accommodation just for helping her take care of two street puppies while I figured out what to do with my life. I was all over it!<br /><br />As soon as we moved in together I began to learn SO MUCH from Esther. This amazing woman runs 2 successful businesses online and eventually she started offering me small jobs here and there, like newsletters and blog writing for her.<br /><br />One of her businesses is called the <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">Virtual Assistant Internship</a>. She hired me to update the site and fix a broken plugin because she just didn’t have the time and she knew that I would do a great job. After going through the content in the <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">90 Day VA course</a>, I started to apply the things I was learning to my own blog. I shared with Esther about the traffic I started getting towards my blog and how her course really made all the difference. Next thing I knew, she offered me a job managing her membership site.<br /><br />And this is where it all began for me.</p>
