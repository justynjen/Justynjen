			<h2> 9 Kick Ass Books to Jump Start Yourself</h2>

				 <p>The first thing that you should know about me is that I LOVE to read. I was that nerd that read under the covers every night thinking that my mom just wouldn’t notice. I just wanted to share my favorite books with you that are totally going to change your life. I know they changed mine!</p>

			<h2> How I Got Started As A Digital Nomad</h2>
			<div class="background-image" style="background-image:url('')">
				<!-- this is a background image -->
			</div>
			<p>
				 <p>Do you ever wonder how I travel to amazing places and make spectacular adventures without coming back to the states to work? That is the biggest question I get from almost everyone. They wonder what I do for money, how I do it and how I get to travel all the time while doing it. This post is meant to teach you all my secrets!<br /><br />First things first, I do not travel the world for free and I do not travel without working. Surprise! I work full time online while also traveling full time (which is a full-time job). So, you could say that I am a busy woman. But, I am living the life of my dreams! And you can too.<br /><br />I started working online less than a year ago. Before that I was just traveling full time and running out of money. You may have heard my story before of how I got started working but let me share it again.<br /><br />After 2 years of full time travel I ran out of money. I spent my last dollars on a blogging course in Bali with the Blonde Abroad and that was it. Unfortunately, shortly after the retreat began, I realized that I wasn’t going to start making money immediately on my blog just because I spent two weeks working with an awesome blogger.  Which then made me realize that my only options were to look for some kind of job abroad or fly home. Then I remembered I didn’t have any money to book a ticket home so, I was stranded in Bali with nowhere to live, no job and obviously, no money.<br /><br />That’s when things were truly bad, but also actually good. I was swimming at the pool with some friends when I confided in them that I had no money and nowhere to live. My new bestie Esther offered to let me live with her while she did a pet sitting gig in Denpasar.  This meant free accommodation just for helping her take care of two street puppies while I figured out what to do with my life. I was all over it!<br /><br />As soon as we moved in together I began to learn SO MUCH from Esther. This amazing woman runs 2 successful businesses online and eventually she started offering me small jobs here and there, like newsletters and blog writing for her.<br /><br />One of her businesses is called the <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">Virtual Assistant Internship</a>. She hired me to update the site and fix a broken plugin because she just didn’t have the time and she knew that I would do a great job. After going through the content in the <a href="https://virtualassistantinternship.com?aff=justynjen">90 Day VA course</a>, I started to apply the things I was learning to my own blog. I shared with Esther about the traffic I started getting towards my blog and how her course really made all the difference. Next thing I knew, she offered me a job managing her membership site.<br /><br />And this is where it all began for me.</p>

			<p>
				 <p>Ever since dropping out of school I have tried to find ways to continue teaching myself new things. I decided to do that through podcasts. Podcasts are amazing for many reasons. You can listen to Podcasts that teach you something new and interesting, ones that inspire you or just ones that make you laugh out loud. In personal life and work life, podcasts can be amazing. I try to listen to one every morning with my breakfast and coffee, before I start my day! Here are some of my favorites!</p>

			<h2> The Best Coworking Spaces in Bali</h2>
			<div class="background-image" style="background-image:url('')">
				<!-- this is a background image -->
			</div>
			<p>
				 <p>Bali has a growing community of Digital Nomads and Expats living the island life. It is full of Cafe’s and coworking spaces that we all gather to work at, network and relax. Before coming to Bali I had no idea what “Coworking” was. Coworking means the use of an office or other working environment by people who are self-employed or working for different employers, typically so as to share equipment, ideas, and knowledge. In Bali’s case, coworking is just that, sharing the wi-fi, sharing ideas and sharing contacts to grow your network and your business.</p>
