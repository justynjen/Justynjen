  <h2 class="center"> 7 Ted Talks Everyone Should Listen Too </h2>
  <p>  </p>
    <div class="col-8_xs-12 content">

      <p>I decided to share with you a few of my favorite tedtalks! I really think that these are something that everyone can benefit from. </p>

<h4 id="inside-the-mind-of-a-master-procrastinator--tim-urban">Inside the mind of a master procrastinator | Tim Urban</h4>

<h4><img src="/uploads/master-procrastinator-by-tim-urban1.PNG" alt="" /></h4>

<p>In Tim Urban’s Ted Talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU">“Inside the mind of a master procrastinator”</a> he starts off by talking about the kind of procrastinator that is good at getting things done at the last minute. In his light and humorous way, he makes you feel like it’s not so bad to work like this until he dives into what happens when there isn’t a deadline on your procrastinating and you are stuck watching your life scurry by. Tim’s talk is designed to open you up to understand that sometimes waiting for the ‘panic monster’ as he puts it isn’t good enough and that you need to start taking a step forward, even if that step is tomorrow. I need this because I often find that I can be the queen of procrastination. Who agrees?</p>

<h4 id="how-to-travel-the-world-with-almost-no-money--tomislav-perko">How to travel the world with almost no money | Tomislav Perko</h4>

<h4 id="-1"><img src="/uploads/how-to-travel-the-world-with-almost-no-money-by-tomislav-perko1.PNG" alt="" /></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7vmHGAshi8">“How to travel the world with almost no money” by Tomislav Perko</a> might demonstrate what I do on a daily basis but on the more extreme side. I love this talk because of what Tomislav is able to do and has been doing by traveling with no money. What I feel like I am constantly doing… I look up to him and know that if my funds did dwindle anymore than they already do, I would still be able to do what I love and make the most out of it. Tomislav also brings up the myths that revolve around international travel and how it is dangerous and you could die. This is true about all things though, right? Travel is much safer than the media gives it credit for being so don’t let being scared be a reason to stay home. Take Mr. Perko’s experiences as a master hitchhiker and couch surfer for example. He is fun to watch and his adventures are great! Go check it out!</p>

<h4 id="the-real-reason-i-traveled-to-196-countries--cassie-de-pecol">The real reason I traveled to 196 countries | Cassie De Pecol</h4>

<h4 id="-2"><img src="/uploads/the-real-reason-i-traveled-to-196-countries-by-cassie-de-pecol1.PNG" alt="" /></h4>

<p>Honestly, it doesn’t get any more inspiring than listening to Cassie De Pecol talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMM-mr4CTY0">“The real reason I traveled to 196 countries.”</a> This Ted Talk makes me believe that I truly can accomplish anything I set my mind to. Not only that, but I can totally relate to her in my times of wondering whether or not I can continue to live the life I have chosen or if I should just go home and get a 9-5 and settle. No! That is not who I am and with Cassie’s inspiring story I know that I can make it through and if you watch her, you will too!</p>

<h4 id="travel-more--buy-less--luis-vargas">Travel More &amp; Buy Less. | Luis Vargas</h4>

<h4 id="-3"><img src="/uploads/travel-more-and-buy-less-by-luis-vargas1.PNG" alt="" /></h4>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlCqyZEXM1I">Luis Vargas</a> is awe inspiring! In his Ted Talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlCqyZEXM1I">“Travel More and Buy Less”</a> he talks about his struggle growing up in California but having been born in Mexico, he felt like he didn’t really belong either place. Traveling helped him truly find who he was in this great wide world. I loved listening to him because he was funny and relatable. Let’s face it, we all really do spend money on things that we probably don’t need half the time. They say a picture is worth a thousand words… So what do you think a whole experience full of adventurous videos you took and all those hot selfies on the beach would cost?? Luis really inspires the non-travelers to plan their first trip but also those of us seasoned travelers to keep exploring new and exciting places.</p>

<h4 id="im-home-how-10-years-of-travel-helped-me-find-belonging--phil-cha">I’m home: How 10 years of travel helped me find belonging. | Phil Cha</h4>

<h4 id="-4"><img src="/uploads/how-10-years-of-travel-helped-me-find-belonging-by-phil-cha1.PNG" alt="" /></h4>

<p>This is one of my most favorite Ted Talks that you must listen to or watch! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXBgitBX5Q0">“I’m home: How 10 years of travel helped me find belonging” by Phil Cha</a> has been a pivotal talk for me in discerning who I am and what I want. I know it doesn’t seem like it but I struggle with belonging and the need to feel loved and like I am a part of something bigger. Sometimes, just like most of you I am sure, I start to get down and feel like I need to change something about who I am or what I want so that I can feel like I fit somewhere. Phil really brought it home for me that I am where I belong and am gathering up pieces of myself as I go and am adding them to an already whole picture that continues to grow. Let him inspire you as much as he did me. Remember to always surround yourself with the best raindrops!</p>

<h4 id="the-benefits-of-rejection--magna-gopal">The Benefits of Rejection | Magna Gopal</h4>

<h4 id="-5"><img src="/uploads/benefits-of-rejection-by-magna-gopal1.PNG" alt="" /></h4>

<p>This was an excellent talk that put words to what we feel when we are the ones saying no or having to receive the rejection. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lE-tbb-R_A">“The Benefits of Rejection” by Magna Gopal</a> she talks about how she learned to handle rejection and how to be a better rejector. She taught me that it isn’t about hurting the other person when you want to say no unless that’s what you define your ‘no’ to be. She continues that honesty is the best policy and empathy is your biggest advocate when delivering rejection. Also, when receiving the big ‘no’ we don’t need to take it personally and can learn from the experience. She finishes her Ted Talk with an excellent poem that she wrote to summarize: Now, we are both here, present and sincere. This is how we choose to live. Check out her talk, you won’t be disappointed!</p>

<h4 id="the-skill-of-humor--andrew-tarvin">The Skill of Humor | Andrew Tarvin</h4>

<h4 id="-6"><img src="/uploads/the-skill-of-humor-by-andrew-tarvin1.PNG" alt="" /></h4>

<p>WTF! Wow, that’s fun! Wouldn’t life be so much sweeter if more people saw WTF and thought wow that’s fun? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdZAMSyn_As">“The Skill of Humor” by Andrew Tarvin</a> was an excellent way to remind me that humor is a choice. You could say that unfortunate things tend to happen to me. I swear my luggage is ALWAYS the one getting shoveled through for one and lately it seems like my airlines enjoy waiting for me to show up to the airport to inform me my flight was cancelled before I even needed to get up at 2 am to get there. I could easily look at these things in a negative aspect but instead, I choose to laugh and enjoy. Humor is also an excellent way to get to know someone. Being able to smile and laugh with a person, whether a long time friend or a stranger, will connect you in a more meaningful way. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like to laugh so you should listen to Andrew as he teaches about humor through humor.</p>

      <h4 class="shorelines lineHeight center">Hello!</h4>
      <p>My name is Justyn. Pronounced Just(in). Most people want to know if I was given this name for a reason, but as I always tell them, no my name has no meaning. It is just a name my dad was set on naming me whether I was a boy or not. I know now that I was given this name because I was meant to stand out and what better way to stand out then to be a girl with boy’s name. That’s the first question I get everytime I introduce myself.</p>
