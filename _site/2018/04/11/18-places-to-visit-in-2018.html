  <h2 class="centered"> 18 Places to Visit in 2018 </h2>
  <hr class="center"> </hr>
  <p>  </p>
  <div class="posts">
   <p>Starting the year off right, I decided to choose 18 places that I wanted to visit in 2018.</p>

<p>This year I want to return to some of my favorite places but I also want to visit some amazing new places that this world has to offer. So this is my list - you could say it’s my travel bucket list just for this year but considering we are already in April (where does my time go?!) some of this might have to spill into next year. Let me know if you have been to any of these places and what you thought of them though!</p>

<h4 id="south-africa">South Africa.</h4>

<p>I was inspired to go to South Africa by Kiersten, from the Blonde Abroad. She always posts the most beautiful pictures from SA, it makes me so excited to visit. I also hear amazing things about it from everyone I talk to that has been there.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/cape-town-3262545-1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="cambodia">Cambodia.</h4>

<p>I have wanted to go to Cambodia for a long time. It was actually part of my plan to go last year and I missed it due to the inability to leave Bali. So this year, I am determined to go!</p>

<h4 id="new-zealand">New Zealand.</h4>

<p> Mountains, fresh air and kiwi’s. Why wouldn’t I want to go? I have always heard the best things about New Zealand and I really hope that this year I can make it to this stunning country.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/new-zealand-679068-1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="myanmar">Myanmar.</h4>

<p>This beautiful country is home to many cultures and ethnic groups. It is surrounded by many strong nations and is home to intense marketplaces and ancient relics dating back to the 6th century! It’s going to be a great cultural experience.</p>

<h4 id="nepal">Nepal.</h4>

<p>Everything Nepal sounds like a dream to me. I can’t wait to go and learn about their cultures, volunteer and trek into their picture perfect landscapes. Ultimate goal: Hike to the Mt Everest Basecamp. That’s probably as far as I’d make it unless I get in A LOT better shape lol.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/art-3311230-1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="morocco">Morocco.</h4>

<p>Beautiful deserts and beaches bordering the Atlantic ocean, marketplaces full of stunning jewelry, ceramic and metal works of art… What more do I have to say?! I must go here.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/desert-2435404-1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="egypt">Egypt.</h4>

<p>Ever since I was little I have had this weird obsession with Egyptian culture. When I was little, I used to pretend that I was Cleopatra. Going to Egypt was my dream come true and you should all add it your list. If you need more inspiration, check out the <a href="/2018/03/31/10-things-i-loved-about-egypt.html">10 Things I Loved About Egypt!</a></p>

<p><img src="/uploads/dsc07286-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="chile">Chile.</h4>

<p>With one of the most diverse landscapes, I am looking forward to visiting Chile. First I want to visit Easter Island, explore Torres Del Paine National Park then journey up to a city that lives in a high-altitude desert climate. This country has so much to offer that I can’t wait to enjoy.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/chile-1477188-1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="latvia">Latvia.</h4>

<p>Two summers ago I wanted to go to Riga (which is the capital of Latvia) but we didn’t have time because of a festival that we were trying to make it too. It’s time to make up for that. Riga is a small and beautiful European town, with all the colorful buildings and stunning churches that you love about Europe, but on a road much less traveled.</p>

<h4 id="lithuania">Lithuania.</h4>

<p>Since we are talking about Latvia, I really can’t wait to visit it’s neighbor country, Lithuania. It also borders the Baltic Sea and has some well known Gothic and Renaissance architecture as well as an 18th century cathedral built on a pagan temple site. It is said to have the most breathtaking views there so of course it’s on the list.</p>

<h4 id="poland">Poland.</h4>

<p>This is actually Lithuania’s neighbor country but more than just trying to hit more than one country in the area, Poland has an ambiance from WWII about it that I have always wanted to explore. You know how much I love history so this place will be awesome. It also has great prices compared to the rest of Europe, so it’s a great place to hit if you have a tighter budget.</p>

<p><img src="blob:https://app.cloudcannon.com/62d44b7d-2242-425d-b7e4-d3376087b0f2" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="south-korea">South Korea.</h4>

<p>I actually ended up having a layover here and it was the best airport I had ever been in. They let me shower and I got to hang out in a special lounge area. Come to find out that you can even tour the capitol, Seoul, for free no matter how long your layover is. I didn’t get to take advantage of this but I can’t wait to get back there and explore the green rolling hill freckled with cherry trees and blossoms.</p>

<h4 id="vietnam">Vietnam.</h4>

<p>A place known for its beaches and incredibly kind people as well as huge bustling cities that most Asian countries are known for with large buildings and a wild night life. I had a visa to go to Vietnam last year but ended up getting wrapped up in Bali and never left. I am hoping to make up for that by hitting Vietnam this year.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/scenery-2846777-1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="denmark">Denmark.</h4>

<p>I am dying to visit this Denmark. A Scandinavian country bordering Sweden and Norway with brightly colored half-timbered houses and cobblestone streets. I loved Sweden and Norway so now I have to visit Denmark.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nyhavn-1835610-1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="jordan">Jordan.</h4>

<p>Jordan is an amazing country and even more amazing beyond just visiting Petra. Visiting Amman, the country’s capital is the perfect way to spend a day. You can wander around the streets and buy practically anything, for a great price. You can also head out to Petra and spend weeks just doing desert activities. Jordan has hiking, thrills and wonderful locals. If you haven’t been, it should be on your bucket list.</p>

<h4 id="israel">Israel.</h4>

<p>I don’t even have words to begin to explain why you should go to Israel. The food, the people, the culture. If Israel is not on your list then change that right now. I loved everything about Israel - I can’t wait to go back. I was happy to have Shabbat dinner every Friday, and eat enough Hummus to kill myself. And the Ethiopian food… Okay so all I did in Israel was eat.. But still! It’s wonderful.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/dsc07058-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="mozambique">Mozambique.</h4>

<p>A southern African country with coral for miles along stunning beaches and protected marine life. If you want to explore the ocean and get that gorgeous tan at the same time then this is the place for you as well. I will love every minute but I have to count out the tan lol</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/african-women-walking-along-road-2983081-1920.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h4 id="namibia">Namibia.</h4>

<p>I really want to visit this southwest country in Africa for its diverse wildlife, including a large cheetah population. This country has camping, safari, beaches, canyons and Etosha National Park. Etosha is a wildlife reserve with many different landscapes and I want to visit it really bad!</p>

<p>Please tell me what you think about my list and what you might add! I have the biggest and most never ending bucket list around…</p>
