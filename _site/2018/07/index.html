			<h2> 5 Tips for Traveling to Cuba as an American</h2>
			<div class="background-image" style="background-image:url('')">
				<!-- this is a background image -->
			</div>
			<p>
				 <p>When I heard they were opening the border so that I could finally fly into Cuba, I got my mom on board and we planned a trip. I had always wanted to go to Cuba, and it was never an option. It still wasn’t the easiest, which is why I have put together this post to help others travel as well! (On their own - there is always the cruise option if you wanted to do that) </p>

<h5 id="this-is-all-about-traveling-to-cube-as-an-american">This is all about traveling to Cube as an American! </h5>

<p> </p>

<h4 id="1-getting-your-visas">1. Getting Your Visas</h4>

<p> </p>

<p>Cuba was just recently opened to travel for US citizens but you are still not able to just travel for tourism on your own. You can travel on a tour, booked in the US that takes you around Cuba. However, if you want to go by yourself, you have to have a reason listed in the 12 reasons the US government has designated for Cuba travel. To get your visa, you just apply and pay when you are at the airport or apply online beforehand, though you need to check with your airline to make sure that you do it correctly. We flew from Salt Lake with Jetblue and they have you buy the visa at the counter. It costs $50. For our travel reason we chose “Support for the Cuban people”.</p>

<h3> </h3>

<h4 id="2-handling-money">2. Handling Money</h4>

<p> </p>

<p>We chose to fly into Havana and then from there travel to Trinidad for a few days. We landed in Havana and headed straight to get our money converted. You cannot use your credit cards in Cuba, if they are run by American banks, so you need to take all your money with you in cash. Also, they tax US dollars 10% so if you want to avoid that you can go to the bank and exchange your US dollars for Euros, which is what we did before we left. It may seem a little scary to take all the cash that you are going to need with you on your trip, but Cuba is very safe. We never once felt like we were in danger or anything like that. You can get your money exchanged, either at the airport when you arrive or at the Cadeca’s all over the cities. Just make sure that you have your passport with you when you go.</p>

<p>Another thing to know about the money here is that they have two separate forms of money. One, the CUC is about equal to a USD. The other, CUP is about 25 CUP for 1 USD. Every time that I went to exchange money, they gave me CUC. In Havana I never used the CUP, no one did as far as I saw. Once we got to Trinidad though, having CUP would have been very handy, but every time I paid someone, hoping for CUP change, they never gave it to me. They just gave me change in the CUC. It is all very confusing but I would just stick with the CUC and make sure that if people do give you change; they give you the correct change in the correct currency. I had absolutely no problems with that however.</p>

<h3 id="-1"> </h3>

<h4 id="3-all-things-food">3. All things food!</h4>

<p> </p>

<p>Don’t expect Americanized Cuban food, in Cuba. The flavorful Cuban cuisine that we expected was not what we ended up with. They eat a lot of chicken and fish, and rice and beans. They do not however, eat rice and beans nearly as much as the rest of central America that considers it to be a staple. They eat a lot of fresh fruit, especially for breakfast. We did homestays while we were there and in the mornings, people would cook you breakfast for 5CUC per person. They will generally prepare you coffee and juice, eggs, fruit, and bread and butter. It is a great offer for breakfast and I definitely recommend that you choose that option. Paladara’s are traditional Cuban restaurants, where you will find the locals eating; we tried to eat at those most of the time. In Trinidad we were able to eat at this rooftop restaurant with live music that was adorable. And in Havana out restaurant of choice was called El Biky. It had great pasta and perfectly cooked chicken. We were often able to find pizzas for 1CUC to 2CUC at the most.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4 id="4-finding-the-best-accommodation">4. Finding the Best Accommodation</h4>

<p> </p>

<p>For accommodation in Cuba the best option to go with is the Casa Particulars. I booked mine on Airbnb and if you choose that option, you can $40 free signing up here. We loved everywhere that we stayed. The families that hosted us were amazing. They were so informative and even though we had a huge language barrier, they were happy to chat and try to tell us everything that we should do and eat. I could not imagine staying in Cuba anywhere else, I have already began staying in touch with the people we stayed with and if I ever go back to Cuba, I know that I would be welcome to stay with them again. The houses were all very clean and they even came and cleaned our rooms like hotel service while we were out for the day. My favorite place that we stayed was in Trinidad, I had my own room with Aircon and a nice bathroom with a kitchen and outdoor patio as well. We got to eat our breakfast at the patio table outside and enjoy the outdoors and beautiful plants they had planted everywhere.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4 id="5-getting-around">5. Getting Around </h4>

<p> </p>

<p>For transportation we mostly ended up taking taxi cabs of different variety everywhere. You can literally take a taxi anywhere; they have those amazing old cars, bikes with a little backseat for you. Then they have traditional yellow taxi cabs, those are the most expensive though. Always make sure before going anywhere that you know how much you are going to get charged because most of the time they do not turn on the meter for tourists. Some taxis did use the meter, but it was uncommon. Our original plan was to take the viazul bus to Trinidad but we didn’t book in advance so when we got to the bus station we found out that there was no available bus to take. If this happens to you, your options are to take a shared taxi or a private taxi. We ended up in a private taxi because the guy gave us about a $60 deal off and they would take us and return to bring us back to Havana; besides my parents were way more interested in a private air conditioned taxi for just us.</p>

<h3 id="-2"> </h3>

<h4 id="what-did-it-cost">What did it cost?</h4>

<p> </p>

<p>I always keep track and document all the money spent while I am traveling and I decided to share that here with you, so you can have an idea of how much money you should bring, since you have to carry it all with you when you go. Cuba is more expensive, compared to the other Central American countries, so you need to keep that in mind. While the accommodation was fairly cheap and you can find cheap eats, things seem to add up quickly and we spent a lot more than I have in other surrounding countries.</p>

<p>The entire trip cost us $1,421.48. </p>

<p>This is pretty good considering there were 3 of us. So this is a budget for 3 people, it also includes the cigars that my parents bought. So all in all, one person in Cuba for one week may spend an average of about $67.69 a day. If you are able to ride the bus instead of taking a taxi in between cities you will save a lot of money, and if you avoid buying cigars and other things that we bought, you’ll be doing even better than that. We were able to fly roundtrip from Salt Lake to Havana for $400 per person, which was a really good deal as well. As long as you plan it right, and far enough in advance you can have a fairly cheap trip to Cuba!</p>

<p>I hope this helps with planning your trip to Cuba! I would love to hear about your experiences and what you were able to see and do while you were in Cuba. It is such a special country and I feel very blessed to have been able to go with my parents. Next time we will know what to do even better and other places that we can go as well! I am looking forward to being able to return to Cuba one day.</p>

			<h2> 5 Ways to Get Your First Client Today!</h2>
			<div class="background-image" style="background-image:url('')">
				<!-- this is a background image -->
			</div>
			<p>
				 <p> </p>

<p>Well you’ve decided to be a freelancer. Good for you! Now you are on the magical journey of trying to figure out how you can start getting clients. Let’s talk for a quick second about the places that I do not recommend going for these clients.</p>

<p> </p>

<ol>
  <li>Upwork - Listen, I don’t care what anyone else had told you, it sucks. They take 20% of your money - which is a ton in the grand scheme of things. They don’t pay you until you have $100 and they don’t protect you if you do the work and the client suddenly decided they don’t need it anymore. They just say, oh well, you did all that work for nothing. See yah. Your money in Escrow will just head straight back into that clients account. BUH BYE. So no thanks, I am done getting screwed over by Upwork. Not to mention, clients on there want cheap work. They don’t want to pay for quality.</li>
  <li>Guru - got totally screwed out of $2,000 because my client disappeared and they did nothing to help me.</li>
  <li>Fiverr - nothing I do is worth $5. NOTHING.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p>Alright that’s enough of that. Let’s talk about 5 ways that you can start getting real, legit clients today!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>First things first join some Facebook groups and start being active in them right away! Don’t spam people because they will hate you, but find ways to be active. Ask for feedback, give feedback. Participate. Post pictures of your dogs. The more people know you, the more likely they are to recommend or hire you!</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Secondly, customize your resume! Every job you apply for should get a customized resume and cover letter. Do you have no idea what I am talking about? Go ahead and talk to Taylor at Remote Like Me. She created a course just for this. You can sign up today and start applying better tomorrow.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Third, make sure that you are following people directions. If they say to email them and in the header tell them your dogs name and then to forward that to your second aunt and then tell them what your favorite starbucks beverage is and why. THEN DO IT. You have a way better chance of standing out when you actually take the time to follow people’s directions.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Fourth, make sure that you put together samples of your work. Don’t have any samples? Go offer to do something for someone for free to get a sample. Don’t want to do that? That’s okay, go and do stuff for yourself. I started a blog for several reasons:</p>

<p> </p>

<ol>
  <li>Website example - shows people my web dev skills</li>
  <li>Writing examples - tons of content on here that i have written!</li>
  <li>Graphics and photography examples</li>
  <li>Stats! This one is the most important. I have good stats for my own blog - which then shows people what I can do for them! Holla!</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p>Now finally, to start getting clients right away, you need to be applying, A LOT. A friend once told me that I will hear back on 1 in 10 applications. That’s the truest thing that I have ever been told. So how do you battle this? You apply, a lot!</p>

<p>A little last thing, I am going to link some resources where you can find legit jobs to apply to, without having to use Facebook Groups alone or sites like Upwork!</p>

<p> </p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="workingnomads.co/jobs" target="_blank">Working Nomads</a></li>
  <li><a href="remoteworkhub.com" target="_blank">Remote Work Hub</a> - has a paid version, but I just use the free version!</li>
  <li><a href="remotelikeme.com" target="_blank">Remote Like Me</a></li>
  <li><a href="thenomadlist.com" target="_blank">The Nomad List</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://digitalnomadgirls.com/jobs/" target="_blank">Digital Nomad Girls Job Board</a></li>
</ol>

<p> </p>

<p>And yah the other option that I always tell people to go with is Facebook Groups! I have gotten MOST of my work in Facebook Groups. I will leave the links for some of the groups I am in below as well!</p>

<p> </p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/365479800498644/" target="_blank">Remote Like Me Community</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/virtualassistantinternship/" target="_blank">Work From Home (without selling anything)</a></li>

			<h2> Surviving an Overnight Bus in India</h2>
			<div class="background-image" style="background-image:url('')">
				<!-- this is a background image -->
			</div>
			<p>
				 <p>Finally getting around to writing about my trip to India! That’s usually how it goes, wouldn’t you agree? You go on a trip and then approximately 6 months later you finally write about it…</p>

<p>While I was in India I had the great pleasure of taking several overnight (16+ hour long) bus journeys. What a joy it was. The first bus journey wasn’t so bad. We traveled from Bangalore to Goa. This was the longest bus journey. We were told it would be around 12 hours and it ended up being something more like 17 hours. The part that wasn’t so bad though was that it was a proper sleeper bus, so we got to lie down. I was also lucky to have a bunk with Christina (my fab German friend from Birdwinks).</p>

<p>Chris and I curled up to watch Superwoman and after that I was able to get a few hours of sleep though I mostly stared out the window waiting desperately to arrive. The rough news was, I did happen to sleep through the 1 stop we had and wasn’t able to use the toilet for HOURS.</p>

<p>The next overnight bus right we took was miserable. It was on a traditional bus, for 15 hours through the mountains from Dehli to Manali. What made the bus ride even worse though was the fact that we stood on the side of the road for an extra 3 hours waiting for the bus to arrive!</p>

<p>Luckily I had plenty of Dramamine and movies downloaded. Niklas and I watched Stranger Things the whole way and I don’t think I slept a wink.</p>

<p>However, the overnight bus that takes the cake for being the absolute worse was the ride back from Manali down to Dehli. The roads were so windy, I had no motion sickness pills left and to make matters worse, I think more than half the people on the bus were sick. It was nauseating to say the least.</p>

<p>We made one stop on the journey and everyone was sick. I was basically dying. I couldn’t wait for us to be back in Dehli.</p>

<p>That’s why I have decided to share with you everything you need to be more prepared than I was for those treacherous overnight buses in India.</p>

<p> </p>

<h4 id="what-to-pack-for-an-overnight-bus-in-india">What to pack for an overnight bus in India</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Plenty on Motion Sickness medicine. I mean PLENTLY. Like basically pack enough for the entire bus full of people and then just hand it out to them as they get on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Download movies and tv shows. These buses may say they are 9 hours but chances are it’s going to be more like 15 hours. So be prepared with entertainment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Snacks and food! We did stop for food once on the ride but it’s always nice to have lots of snacks. (The bus to Goa didn’t really stop for food, but it did have a few snack options when they stopped the one time) If you sleep through the bus stopping or your bus ends up taking 5 hours longer than expected, you are going to be grateful for that extra bag of chips you picked up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Like snacks, take plenty of water and other things to drink. I like to have plenty of water but I am also one of those people who wants to have something with flavor. So I brought water and juice. But remember, the bus only stops one or two times and none of my buses had toilets onboard! So don’t drink too much!</li>
  <li>Warm clothes/an extra scarf and sweater to curl up in! I found all the buses to be freezing. Especially if you are sat next to the window. I froze, so I was very grateful to have an extra sweater and scarf with me to curl up in.</li>
  <li>Extra battery charger. One of my buses had plugs but in true India fashion, they didn’t work. So take an external battery charger just to be safe!</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="what-to-prepare-before-going-on-the-bus">What to prepare before going on the bus</h4>

<p>Here’s just a few things to have done before you get on the bus!</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Pack all your valuables so that they stay on your person. You don’t want to store anything valuable under the bus.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Charge all your devices! Like I said before, no plugs. So make sure that you have your computer, phone, tablet and anything else fully charged.</li>
  <li>Make sure that your bag fits in the small overhead storage space! I left my bag on the floor under my seat for one ride (The horrible ride back to Dehli) and it ended up covered in throwup! Don’t make my mistake! Take two small bags if you must. Anything to keep those things stored over your head.</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are my best tips for surviving those long haul overnight buses through India! I hope that you can learn from my mistakes and have a much more pleasant experience!</p>
