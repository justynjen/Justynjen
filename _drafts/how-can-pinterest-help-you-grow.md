Are you on Pinterest? Chances are, that answer is yes! However, are you using Pinterest to help you grow your business? That answer might be noâ€¦&nbsp;

Your next question for me might be something like, how can Pinterest help me grow my business? Pinterest is for cooking and weddings and wasting time. You have never been more wrong.&nbsp;

Pinterest is one of the strongest tools you can be using to send traffic to your website or blog and explode your business. It's about time we take Pinterest out of the social media category and put it in the business tools category.&nbsp;

I've been helping bloggers and small business owners grow their following and drive thousands of people to their websites every month! How am I doing that? Well let's get started on working out what kind of business Pinterest are for.

Pinterest is the strongest tool to grow blog traffic for sure. So bloggers looking to up their traffic and make money through their affiliates, should be ALL over Pinterest. Another great way for bloggers to make money on Pinterest is to have their low priced products on Pinterest for people to see and buy. I have found that worksheets, downloads and eBooks do amazing on Pinterest!&nbsp;

Does your business have physical products? No worries! Things like home furnishings, scrapbook/journaling supplies, clothes, kitchen wears, art and photos, all do so well selling on Pinterest. Well that sounds like just about everything right? That's right. Pinterest can actually help you sell everything. You see brands like Target and Nike advertising on Pinterest, what makes you think you should be ignoring the platform?&nbsp;

#### Setting up Pinterest for your business

&nbsp;

Now, I have worked out a bit of a strategy on how to target and direct that growth in the shortest amount of time. If you would like to learn more about that, you can book a 15 minute consultation with me where I can take a look at your accounts and let you know how we can make magic for your business.&nbsp;

#### First things first, your account settings

&nbsp;

The first thing that you need to do when you are updating your Pinterest is that you need to change your account to a business account. Once you have that done, you are going to find a whole new world of analytics! Pinterest Analytics are amazing. They will show you how much traffic your account gets, but also how much traffic goes from your account back to your website. It's amazing.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

#### Secondly, set up your boards

&nbsp;

Right now you might have all those dream boards of crafts you want to make and homes you wished your owned. That's great, but for business reasons let's go ahead and make those private. Now you just need to set up some boards that are all related to your business. Have a scroll through my Pinterest to get an idea. Or through Taylor @RemoteLikeMe, I helped her set hers up!&nbsp;

#### Third, Tailwinds

&nbsp;

Now Tailwinds is going to change your life. I pin about 25 times a day on my account thanks to Tailwinds. It's a huge lifesaver.&nbsp;
