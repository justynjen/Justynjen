Being a digital nomad requires that you have a few essential things with you all the time. I easily manage travel full time but I wouldn’t be able to do it without all of these things in my back pack!

HP Spectre Laptop. 

This Laptop is amazing. I cannot speak highly of it. It’s light weight and extremely powerful. It has an incredible 4k touch screen that I use for Digital Illustration. The screen has 4k resolution and this computer is a winner when it comes to multitasking.

The Surface Arc Mouse. 

This mouse folds up to be basically flat. I love it. The battery life lasts forever and it folds right down to fit into my computer bag. I love having a mouse on hand.

The Surface Pro Pen. 

I promise I don’t even have a surface, I just LOVE their products for touch screen computers and travel. This pen is amazing. It takes my design work to the next levels, and allows me to make personal notes of my portfolio to point out to people exactly what I want them to see. (Certain computers do come with their own pen, but it your doesn’t, check this out!) Another GREAT option is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076VQB8DQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B076VQB8DQ&linkCode=as2&tag=justynjen07-20&linkId=d6ac9b298f38926af03de3c1acbb7af3">Wacom Bamboo Ink Smart Stylus Black Active Touch Pen Stylus for Windows 10 Touchscreen Input Devices Surface Pro - CS321AK</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B076VQB8DQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Battery pack.

Having a really good battery pack can really change things for you. Being able to charge your phone on the go is amazing. This way you can always be available to check the map, answer an email, call someone, or do anything else while out and about. Just throw the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X5RV14Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00X5RV14Y&linkCode=as2&tag=justynjen07-20&linkId=fbe67f8801a333f5ec3f791e343f36a9">Anker PowerCore External Battery Pack</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=justynjen07-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00X5RV14Y" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> into your bag and you are ready to go all day, and all night.

What better way to stay organized then with a power cord organizer?! This way you can always find what you are looking for. No more lost cords, anywhere! I love it. I swear I have always been that person that loses all their cords and then finds them all tangled into one jumbled mess! But no more! Now I can always find everything and it’s amazing. You have to get one of these. Just throw it into your bag and you will always have everything you need. 


Power converter. 

I really cannot recommend enough that you grab one of these before taking off on your next trip. Let me just tell you a quick horror story about foreign plugs and power. THEY ARENT GREAT. I spent about 7 months living in Bali and during that time I had two friends gopros break and my LAPTOP BROKE. The power in Bali blew my motherboard. That’s right. It fried my computer. And you know why? Because I used some cheapo plug that I bought for a dollar. And like I said, I had multiple friends blow their gopros and have them just stop charging. Not to mention phones blowing and more. The power in the country was wack and now I always travel with a high tech power converter to make sure that NEVER happens to me again. Check this one out, it does a great job and I always feel much safer using it. Don’t risk it guys! This is a lot cheaper than replacing all your nice electronics when they blow out.

This is the best way to save your back when you are always working from your laptop. They always say that it’s best no to be looking down at your screen all day, and this guy folds right up to travel with you! You can easily throw it in your laptop bag and head out and about.
