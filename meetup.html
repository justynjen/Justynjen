      <h4 class="shorelines">Who am I anyway?</h4>
      <p>My name is Justyn and I have been traveling the world for the past 3 years and this last year I started running a business online so I could continue to travel. Now I try to help as many others as I can travel and work online every day! Learn from my mistakes in this day long meetup where I will talk all about:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traveling Full Time</li>
          <p>Including how you can travel for extremely cheap. I will also answer all your questions and share my favorite stories from hostels, couchsurfing and hitchhiking around the world.</p>
        <li>Working Full Time</li>
        <p>I will talk about the different things that you can do online. Where to find online work and how to maintain working while you traveling. This will include my favorite tools and technology that help me on the go!</p>
        <li>And how to still enjoy your life while you do!</li>
        <p>I love being able to work and travel, but there are some things that I have learned as I go to maintain my health and mental state as I go. Anyone who has traveled full time will know that it's a full time job, so adding work in can get pretty overwhelming. Learn how to manage them both!</p>
